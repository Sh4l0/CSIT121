        <p>I wanted to use this page to talk about some of the things I've learned about HTML!</p>
        <h2>HTML Rules | Entry one</h2>
        <ol>
            <li class="match">Tags must come in pairs</li>
            <li class="match">Tags are contained in angled brackets</li>
            <li class="match">Tags are usually in lowercase</li>
        </ol>
        <p>Below is a link to a website that helped me alot to learn</p>
        <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/html/default.asp">W3Schools</a>

        <h2>CSS Rules | Entry two</h2>
